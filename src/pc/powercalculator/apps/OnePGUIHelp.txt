This dialog provides for power analysis of a one-
sample test of proportions.  You have your choice of
the normal approximation, the beta approximation
(which is more accurate), or two exact calculations
based on the binomial distribution.  In the latter
cases, the size of the test (i.e., the probability of
a type I error) is often much smaller than the stated
significance level.

MORE DETAILS
Common notations: Suppose that X is a binomial random
variable with "success" probability p and n
independent trials, and let P = X/n.

Normal approximation: 
We approximate distribution of P with 
N(mu=p, sigma^2=p*(1-p)/n). This has the same mean and
variance as the true distribution of P. The critical
region is obtained using this approximation with p=p0,
then the power is computed using this approximation
with p=p1.

Beta approximation: 
We approximate distribution of P with 
Beta(a=(n-1)*p, b=(n-1)*(1-p)). This has the same mean
and variance as the true distribution of P. The
critical region is obtained using this approximation
with p=p0, then the power is computed using this
approximation with p=p1.

Exact:
In the exact test, the significance level alpha is
taken as an upper bound on the size of the test (its
power under the null hypothesis). Since X has a
discrete distribution, the size cannot be controlled
exactly and is often much lower than the specified
alpha.

For the alternative p < p0, let xl denote the largest
x for which Pr(X <= x | p = p0) <= alpha.  
Then the power is equal to Pr(X <= xl | p = p1) 
and the size of the test is Pr(X <= xl | p = p0).

For the alternative p > p0, let xu denote the smallest
x for which Pr(X >= x | p = p0) <= alpha.
Then the power is equal to Pr(X >= xu | p = p1).
and the size of the test is Pr(X >= xu | p = p0).

For the alternative p != p0, compute both powers as
above but replace alpha by alpha/2; then sum the
powers and sizes.

Exact (Wald CV):
This is like the exact method, except the critical
values are calculated based on an adjusted Wald
statistic.  This does NOT guarantee that the size
of the test is less than alpha.
Let
  pAdj = (x + 2) / (n + 4),
  z = (pAdj - p0) / sqrt{pAdj * (1 - pAdj) / (n + 4)}
  zCrit = (1 - alpha) quantile of the N(0,1)
    distribution (for a two-sided test, use the 
    1 - alpha/2 quantile).
Then xl is the largest x such that z <= -zCrit, and 
xu = smallest x such that z >= zCrit.  Compute the
power as in the exact method using these critical
values.
Note: This is the exact method used in the JMP
statistical software.
