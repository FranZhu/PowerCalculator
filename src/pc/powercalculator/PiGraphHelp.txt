Power Calculator Graphical Dialog Help

All of the numerical variables in the
dialog are available for simple interactive
graphing.  The user may select the "y" and "x" 
variables from the drop-down menus and specify their
range and increment.

This will be a graph of the two variables, given
the current values of the remaining variables.
The graph is updated when there are actions in
the dialog.  If the "Persistent" box is
checked, new curves are added to the current
graph; otherwise the curve is replaced.

If the "Show Data" button is pressed, a text
window appears that lists the data for each
curve, plus information about the values of the
other variables. These data may be pasted into
another application if a publication-quality
graph is needed.

You may have as many graphs going as you like;
of course this can affect performance.
