Help for Power Calculator Dialogs

Overview
-----------
The PowerCalculator tool includes methods and interfaces 
for computing statistical power or minimum sample-sizes 
required to detect certain effect-sizes for a given power.

Graphical-user-interface (GUI) components
-----------------------------------------
*** Sliders
Parameter values may be changed by
clicking and draging sliders or by entering numerical
values in the corresponding text fields.

Internally, slider inputs are automatically converted to 
numerical values. You can toggle back and forth
between slider mode and text-field mode. A value
entered in the window is accepted when you click
on "OK" or press the "Enter" key.

Options menu
------------
The option menus vary depending on the 
specific power calculation application. 
Some power calculators provide "Graphics" options,
which include client dialogs facilitating
the specification of parameters.
